    Lesson 1: Multiplying by 25
  </h2>
  <div id = border>

          <p>25x32=? <p>
      <div>

    The "why"<p>

    Think of 25 as a fraction.  The fraction form of 25 is 25/1. This is true for any number.  Like 45 = 45/1, 100 = 100/1.<p>

    To make multiplying by 25 easy, we change the fraction 25/1 a bit.<p>

    In this case, 25 is easy to think of as a number out of a 100.  Like a quarter out of a dollar.  So, we can think of 25 as 25/100.  Compare the original to the modified fraction.<p>

    25/1 vs. 25/100<p>

    We are no longer multiplying by 25/1, but we changed it to 25/100.<p>

    25/100 simplified is 1/4.  Think of it.  .25 cents in $1.00.  1 quarter out of 4 quarters.  Same thing, right?  25/100 = 1/4<p>

<div>
    The "what"<p>

    Instead of multiplying 25x32, we are multiplying 1/4x32.  It's not a magic trick, just a shortcut.<p>

    1/4x32 is the same thing as dividing the number 32 by 4.<p>

    The answer to 32 divided by 4 = 8.<p>

    That would be the answer if we were multiplying 1/4, 25/100, 25%, or .25 (all are the same value in different forms) x 32.  But, we are not multiplying any of these x 32. The original number was 25.<p>

    To make it back to 25 we must multiply the 8 (the answer you got by dividing 32 by 4) by 100. It is the same as replacing the decimal point two places to the right to make up for the two places to the left in the beginning.<p>

    So .25 --> 25 is basically what we are doing.<p>

    Do 8x100, which is 800.  The answer to 25x32=800<p>


    What to do if you get a remainder after dividing the other number by 4?<p>

    For example, 27x25=?<p>

    We would divide 27 divided by 4, but in this case it would be 6 remainder 3.<p>
      <div>

    0 remainder = 00 (this number tags along the end, kind of like the 8 became 800)<p>
    1 remainder = 25<p>
    2 remainders = 50<p>
    3 remainders = 75<p>
    </div>

    So, the answer to 27x25=675<p>

  <h2>
    The 50 Trick
  </h2>
  <h4>
    <div>
  50x36=?<p>
The "why"<p>
In the previous lesson, we converted 25 to .25 by making it the fraction 1/4.  We will do something similar with 50.  <p>We will change 50/1 to 50/100.  This is possible, because we go from 50 to .50 and think of it as 2 quarters out of a dollar, .50 cents out of $1.00.
50/100 simplified is 1/2.
So, we replace the 50 with 1/2.<p>
  <div>
The "what"<p>
Since we replaced 50 with 1/2, we are multiplying 1/2x36 for now.<p>
1/2x36 is the same thing as dividing 36 by 2.<p>
The answer to 36 divided by 2 = 18.<p>
 1/2x36=18, but it is not the answer to the original problem 50x36.  See, we changed to 50 to .50, so we have to make it back to 50 again.  <p>To do this, we move the decimal over two places.  Instead, we just add 00 to the end.
So, 50x36=1800<p>
What to do if you get a remainder after dividing the other number by 2?<p>
This happens when you multiply any odd number times 50, because when you divide that number by 2 you will have a remainder.<p>
For example, 50x51=?.<p>
51 divided by 2 = 25 R1 <p>
When you have a remainder of 1, add a 50 at the end instead of 00. <p>
0 remainder = 00<p>
1 remainder = 50 (this number tags along the end)<p>
So, the answer to 50x51=2550<p>
